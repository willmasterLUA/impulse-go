# Welcome to impulse Go
This is a fork of impulse: Enhanced focused on making the schema directly BUILT into the framework, making it a one folder gamemode.
A bunch of fixes have also been added to this framework, which were previously broken by past gmod updates.

This is a experimental schema, if any bugs, please report them on discord: willmasterr

## Copyright
impulse was originally developed by vingard @ 2i.games. impulse: Enhanced is a refresh of the said framework, developed under vanilla Studios, This is a fork of it to make the schema easier to manage.
